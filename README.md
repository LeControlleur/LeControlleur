# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Samuel (but you can call me Sammy)

I'm a Software Engineer with a background in Artificial Intelligence and Big Data. I build robust backend systems, create intelligent solutions, and occasionally talk to my computer to make it work (just kidding, mostly). 

- ðŸ§  Strong focus on applied machine learning, backend architecture, and data-intensive applications  
- ðŸ’» Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript  
- ðŸ”§ Tools & Tech: Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI, Quarkus, Django, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Apache Kafka
- ðŸ§ª Passionate about clean code, automation, system reliability, and AI topics like deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision.

Currently working on projects involving AI-powered video summarization, data pipelines, and scalable backend services.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning more about
- Distributed systems and large-scale infrastructure (because who doesn't love a good challenge?)  
- Model optimization and efficient AI deployment  
- Technical leadership and software architecture (the more I learn, the more I realize how much I still donâ€™t know!)
